            <h2>API/Data Visualization</h2>
            <p>
                Write a mini API wrapper in your favorite language for your favorite source of data. Use it to collect data into your favorite database, and display something interesting about the data, such as a table, network graph, or histogram in an HTML page. For example, you could use Last.FM to take personal listening data and produce a histogram of what hours of the day you listen to the most music. Then you can add a most-listened genre or artist to each hour of the histogram. Feel free to use this idea as a jumping off point for something interesting with music data! And if you borrow any ideas or code, make sure to give credit where it's due.
